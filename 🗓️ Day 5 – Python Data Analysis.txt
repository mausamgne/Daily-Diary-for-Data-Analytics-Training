🗓️ Day 5 – Python Data Analysis & Visualization

Topics Covered:

Explored data analysis using Pandas:

Grouping data: df.groupby('Outlet_Size')['Sales'].sum()

Filtering and sorting using conditions.

Learned data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.

Customized labels, titles, and colors.

Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding trends, patterns, and outliers in data.

Learned about correlation and basic statistics for data interpretation.

Practical Work:

Visualized total sales by outlet type and item type using bar charts.

Drew correlation heatmap for numeric columns (Sales, Rating, Visibility).

Summarized findings and exported cleaned dataset for use in Power BI.

Learning Outcome:
Developed practical data visualization skills and performed exploratory data analysis to extract insights using Python.
