🗓️ Day 9 – DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) & Calculations

Topics Covered:

Introduction to DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) used for creating custom calculations in Power BI.

Learned about:

Calculated Columns – for row-level operations.

Measures – for aggregated calculations.

Practiced common DAX functions:

SUM(), AVERAGE(), COUNT(), DISTINCTCOUNT()

CALCULATE(), FILTER(), IF()

Created Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Sales = SUM(Sales)

Average of Sales = AVERAGE(Sales)

Number of Items = COUNT(Item_Identifier)

Average Rating = AVERAGE(Rating)

Practical Work:

Implemented all DAX measures in the Blinkit dataset.

Displayed DAX measures using KPI cards in Power BI dashboard.

Compared calculated values to dataset totals for validation.

Learning Outcome:
Understood the power of DAX for dynamic calculations and learned how to use measures for creating performance indicators in dashboards.s
