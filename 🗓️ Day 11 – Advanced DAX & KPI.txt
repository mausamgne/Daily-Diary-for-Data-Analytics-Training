🗓️ Day 11 – Advanced DAX & KPI Development

Topics Covered:

Learned advanced DAX functions for creating more insightful calculations.

Studied and practiced:

CALCULATE() – for conditional calculations.

FILTER() – to apply custom filters within measures.

ALL() and REMOVEFILTERS() – to ignore slicers when needed.

Time Intelligence Functions like DATEADD() and TOTALYTD() (for trend analysis).

Created dynamic KPIs to analyze sales growth and item visibility.

Practical Work:

Developed new measures:

Sales Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Sales] - PREVIOUSYEAR([Total Sales]), PREVIOUSYEAR([Total Sales]))

Average Item Visibility = AVERAGE(Item_Visibility)

Combined multiple measures into a summary table for better comparison.

Verified accuracy of all measures using cross-checks with raw data.

Learning Outcome:
Understood how to write and apply advanced DAX expressions to derive deeper insights, such as growth analysis and visibility patterns, essential for professional Power BI reporting.
